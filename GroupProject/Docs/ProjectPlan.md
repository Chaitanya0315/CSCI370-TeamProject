## 1 Introduction

Our team will develop an Android app that will allow the user to create and manage grocery lists.

## 2 Process Description

*Update 1*
- Description of each activity should resemble those described in the [Design Document Template](https://github.com/qc-se-spring2018/370Spring18Team5/blob/master/GroupProject/Design-Team/DesignDocumentTemplate.md)
- Main Activity: Provides user log-in for list access.
- *Entrance criteria*: User uses keyboard to enter info.
- *Exit criteria*: Activity runs as intended when user enters correct info, activity switches to next.
- Grocery Lists Activity: User can choose between Weekly List and Monthly List.
- *Entrance criteria*: Navigated from main activity/log in screen. In this activity, the user can choose between the two lists mentioned above. User can also decide to return to the previous screen if the user chooses to do so.
- *Exit criteria*: Activity runs as intended if user is navigated to the next activity module.
- Weekly Lists Activity: User can view/access his or her shopping items. Provides addition/deletion of items and navigates to previous activity.
- *Entrance criteria*: From grocery list activity, this activity is shown so that the user can view all lists individually.
- *Exit criteria*: Activity is running as intended if user is able to choose which items can be deleted from the list, add, check or navigate to a more concise list.
- Monthly Lists Activity: User can view/access his or her monthly shopping items. Same as above.
- *Entrance criteria*: A more detailed list of user's shopping items.  User is taken to this activity after choosing or clicking which shopping item he/she wants to edit.
- *Exit criteria*: Runs as intended if user is able to edit items to desired outcome.

*Update 2*
- same description can be found in DesignDocumentTemplate.md
- The team decided to remove the user login screen. It may be implemented in a future update of the app.
- At app start-up, user is taken to the Shopping List menu. There is a a FAB (floating action button) on the bottom right corner that the user can click.
- When the user clicks on the FAB button, user is taken to the "Enter List Name" interface. In this interface, the user can enter the list he/she wants to create. When the user hits the check mark, the newly created list is saved in the system and the user is taken to another screen.
